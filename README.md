# HTML5-Canvas-Charts

Project name: Canvas Charts

Link: http://gao00078.edumedia.ca/mad9022/pieChart/index.html


Using the HTML5 Canvas tag and Javascript, I build a web page with two charts representing the same data.


The first Canvas element displays the data as a PIE Chart including labels. I used the same radius for all segments except the largest and the smallest. The largest is 120% of the standard radius and the smallest value is 80% the standard radius.

The second Canvas element displays the same data and labels in a bar chart.
